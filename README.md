### Hello world 👋

- 📱 iOS developer, I've created [GPX viewer](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/gpx-viewer/id1511582047) and [GPX viewer 2](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/gpx-viewer-2/id6444086445) apps. ❣️Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Objective-C

- 🧑🏻‍💻 I work in the company I founded (and sold in 2023) [EDSI-Tech Sàrl](https://edsi-tech.com), as IT Business Analyst and software engineer.
- 🎒 I also teach computer science and project management at [ETML-ES](https://www.etml.ch/formation/es/informatique-de-gestion).
- 🏕 I like hiking in Switzerland mountains.
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I spend more time on developing GPX viewer than actually hiking. 😆
- 💬 Ask me about your project ideas, I can probably help you find technical solution.

🤫 As most of my apps are made for my company or for private use, you won't find a lot of public repos or activities. But I still publish open source projects or libraries you can use in your own apps. Have a look on pinned projects below.

If you need to contact me, you can access my [contact page](https://contact.gander.family?locale=en).
