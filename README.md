### Hello world 👋

- 📱 iOS apps developer, I've created [GPX viewer](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/gpx-viewer/id1511582047?l=fr) app. ❣️Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Objective-C (🦖)

- 🧑🏻‍💻 I work in my own company, [EDSI-Tech Sàrl](https://edsi-tech.com), as IT Business Analyst and software engineer.
- 🎒 I also teach computer science and project management at [ETML](https://www.etml.ch/).
- 🏕 Hiking in Switzerland mountains.
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I spend more time on developing GPX viewer than actually hiking 😆
- 💬 Ask me about your project ideas, I can probably help you find technical solution.

As most of my apps are made for my company or for private use, you won't find a lot of public repos. But I still publish open source example projects or libraries you can use on your own apps.
