### Hello world 👋

- 📱 iOS developer, I've created [GPX viewer](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/gpx-viewer/id1511582047) app. ❣️Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Objective-C

- 🧑🏻‍💻 I work in my own company, [EDSI-Tech Sàrl](https://edsi-tech.com), as IT Business Analyst and software engineer.
- 🎒 I also teach computer science and project management at [ETML](https://www.etml.ch/) and [ETML-ES](https://www.etml-es.ch/).
- 🏕 I like hiking in Switzerland mountains.
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I spend more time on developing GPX viewer than actually hiking. 😆
- 💬 Ask me about your project ideas, I can probably help you find technical solution.

🤫 As most of my apps are made for my company or for private use, you won't find a lot of public repos or activities. But I still publish open source projects or libraries you can use on your own apps. Have a look on [LineChartView](https://github.com/Jonathan-Gander/LineChartView), [CacheHandler](https://github.com/Jonathan-Gander/CacheHandler), [LocalizableChecker](https://github.com/Jonathan-Gander/LocalizableChecker) and [WhatsNewView](https://github.com/Jonathan-Gander/WhatsNewView).

If you need to contact me, you can access my [contact page](https://contact.gander.family?locale=en).
